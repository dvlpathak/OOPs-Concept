    " 1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm that organizes code around objects rather than functions. It's based on four main principles:\n",
    "- Encapsulation: Bundling data and methods together\n",
    "- Inheritance: Creating new classes based on existing ones\n",
    "- Polymorphism: Using a single interface for different underlying data types\n",
    "- Abstraction: Hiding complex implementation details\n",
    "\n",
    "OOP helps create modular, reusable, and maintainable code by modeling real-world entities as objects.\n",
    "\n",
    " 2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the attributes (data) and methods (functions) that objects of that class will have. Think of it as a cookie cutter - it defines the shape and structure, but isn't the actual cookie.\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, brand, model):\n",
    "        self.brand = brand\n",
    "        self.model = model\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def start_engine(self):\n",
    "        return f\"The {self.brand} {self.model} engine is starting\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " 3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "An object is an instance of a class - the actual \"thing\" created from the blueprint. It has specific values for the attributes defined in the class and can use the methods defined in that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "# Creating objects from the Car class\n",
    "my_car = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Camry\")\n",
    "your_car = Car(\"Honda\", \"Civic\")\n",
    "\n",
    "print(my_car.brand)  # Output: Toyota\n",
    "print(my_car.start_engine())  # Output: The Toyota Camry engine is starting\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " 4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction:\n",
    "- Hides complex implementation details\n",
    "- Shows only essential features to the user\n",
    "- Focuses on \"what\" an object does\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation:\n",
    "- Bundles data and methods together\n",
    "- Controls access to internal data using access modifiers\n",
    "- Focuses on \"how\" to protect data\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "# Encapsulation example\n",
    "class BankAccount:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, balance):\n",
    "        self._balance = balance  # Protected attribute\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def deposit(self, amount):\n",
    "        if amount > 0:\n",
    "            self._balance += amount\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def get_balance(self):\n",
    "        return self._balance\n",
    "\n",
    "# Abstraction example\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    def start(self):\n",
    "        self._check_fuel()\n",
    "        self._ignite_engine()\n",
    "        return \"Car started\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def _check_fuel(self):  # Hidden implementation\n",
    "        pass\n",

    " 5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Dunder methods (double underscore methods) are special methods that Python calls automatically in certain situations. They allow you to define how objects behave with built-in operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common dunder methods:\n",
    "- `__init__`: Constructor\n",
    "- `__str__`: String representation for users\n",
    "- `__repr__`: String representation for developers\n",
    "- `__len__`: Length of object\n",
    "- `__add__`: Addition operator\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "class Book:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, title, pages):\n",
    "        self.title = title\n",

    "        return self.pages\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def __add__(self, other):\n",
    "        return self.pages + other.pages\n",
    "\n",
    "book = Book(\"Python Guide\", 300)\n",
    "print(str(book))  # Calls __str__\n",
    "print(len(book))  # Calls __len__\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " 6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class. The child class (subclass) inherits from the parent class (superclass) and can add new features or override existing ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "# Parent class\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",

    "\n",
    "dog = Dog(\"Buddy\")\n",
    "cat = Cat(\"Whiskers\")\n",
    "print(dog.speak())  # Output: Buddy says Woof!\n",
    "print(cat.speak())  # Output: Whiskers says Meow!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " 7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. The same method name can have different implementations in different classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "class Shape:\n",
    "    def area(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class Rectangle(Shape):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, width, height):\n",
    "        self.width = width\n",
    "        self.height = height\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def area(self):\n",
    "        return self.width * self.height\n",
    "\n",

    "    def area(self):\n",
    "        return 3.14159 * self.radius  2\n",
    "\n",
    "# Polymorphism in action\n",
    "shapes = [Rectangle(5, 10), Circle(7)]\n",
    "for shape in shapes:\n",
    "    print(f\"Area: {shape.area()}\")  # Same method, different behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " 8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python achieves encapsulation through naming conventions:\n",
    "- Public: Normal attribute names\n",
    "- Protected: Single underscore prefix `_attribute`\n",
    "- Private: Double underscore prefix `__attribute`\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "class MyClass:\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self.public = \"I'm public\"\n",
    "        self._protected = \"I'm protected\"\n",

    "    \n",
    "    def get_private(self):\n",
    "        return self.__private\n",
    "\n",
    "obj = MyClass()\n",
    "print(obj.public)        # Works\n",
    "print(obj._protected)    # Works but shouldn't be used outside class\n",
    "# print(obj.__private)   # AttributeError - can't access directly\n",
    "print(obj.get_private()) # Proper way to access private data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " 9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "A constructor is a special method that initializes an object when it's created. In Python, the constructor is the `__init__` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "class Student:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age, grade):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",

    " 10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Class methods (`@classmethod`):\n",
    "- First parameter is `cls` (the class itself)\n",
    "- Can access class variables\n",
    "- Called on the class or instance\n",
    "\n",
    "Static methods (`@staticmethod`):\n",
    "- No special first parameter\n",
    "- Independent of class and instance state\n",
    "- Utility functions related to the class\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "class MathUtils:\n",
    "    pi = 3.14159\n",
    "    \n",
    "    @classmethod\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    " 11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python doesn't support traditional method overloading (multiple methods with the same name but different parameters). However, you can achieve similar functionality using default parameters or variable arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "class Calculator:\n",
    "    def add(self, a, b=None, c=None):\n",
    "        if b is None:\n",
    "            return a\n",
    "        elif c is None:\n",
    "            return a + b\n",

    "print(calc.multiply(2, 3, 4)) # 24\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " 12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "Method overriding occurs when a child class provides a different implementation of a method that exists in the parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "class Vehicle:\n",
    "    def start(self):\n",
    "        return \"Vehicle is starting\"\n",

    "print(bike.start())  # Output: Bicycle rider is pedaling\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " 13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "The `@property` decorator allows you to define methods that can be accessed like attributes, providing getter, setter, and deleter functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "class Temperature:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, celsius=0):\n",

    " 14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism provides several benefits:\n",
    "- Code reusability: Same interface for different types\n",
    "- Flexibility: Easy to extend with new types\n",
    "- Maintainability: Changes in one class don't affect others\n",
    "- Abstraction: Work with objects at a higher level\n",
