# OOPs-Concept
This project covers basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python:  Encapsulation – Bundling data and methods together.  Inheritance – Reusing code from a parent class.  Polymorphism – Same method behaving differently in different classes.  Abstraction – Hiding complex details and showing only essentials.
